# RDR2PictureConverter
A small converter tool for the photo mode files from the game Red Dead Redemption 2

## Usage

Simply drop this tool in your Red Dead Redemption 2 profile folder, e.g. `C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Profiles\DEADBEEF` and run it. It will automatically detect all files starting with `PRDR`, and perform the necessary conversation. The new files will be stored as files with the same name, but with the extension `.jpg`
